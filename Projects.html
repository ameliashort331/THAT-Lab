<b>Women’s Health and Technology</b>
<br> Women’s health has a complicated relationship with healthcare institutions and research due to inequities and stigma that women have experienced. This is compounded in menopause, where individuals face barriers due to age stereotypes as well as gender. We are examining the how technology might play a role in experiences with menopause.

<b>Dementia and the use of Information and Communication Technologies</b>
<br>
Though a dominant view of dementia sees it as a condition that erases individuality and the ability to engage in activity, other ways of viewing dementia take into account the importance of the social context, abilities that persist long into dementia, and stigma that isolates and marginalizes people with this condition. In my work, I explore the use of technology to support quality of life and social connectedness. As many of our technologies are designed for a single individual to make decisions, I am currently conducting a study to understand how technologies can be designed to take into account the shared-decision making that takes place between people with dementia, family members, and healthcare professionals.

<b>Attitudes towards Older Adults and Technology Design</b>
<br>
Broad societal views, such as stereotypes based on age, become embedded in and perpetuated through the design of technologies. We have studied the ways that older adults' preferences for technology challenge some of the assumptions that designers and researchers make about older people, particularly in regard to conceptions around social isolation and physical and cognitive decline. We also study how older adults use technology platforms such as blogs and social media to respond to ageism. Relevant publications include:
